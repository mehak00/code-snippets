The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored.

It should be exactly the same as `ins`, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the `bus` dataframe. If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "### Question 7d\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"q7d.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: Use `second_score` and `first_score` created in the scatter plot code above.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: Convert the scores into numpy arrays to make them easier to deal with.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: Use `plt.hist()` Try changing the number of bins when you call `plt.hist()`.\n",
