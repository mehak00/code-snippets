    "**Congratulations**! You've carried out the entire data science lifecycle for a challenging regression problem. \n",

    "In Part 1 on data selection, you solved a domain-specific programming problem relevant to the analysis when choosing only those taxi rides that started and ended in Manhattan.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 2 on EDA, you used the data to assess the impact of a historical event---the 2016 blizzard---and filtered the data accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 3 on feature engineering, you used PCA to divide up the map of Manhattan into regions that roughly corresponded to the standard geographic description of the island.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 4 on model selection, you found that using linear regression in practice can involve more than just choosing a design matrix. Tree regression made better use of categorical variables than linear regression. The domain knowledge that duration is a simple function of distance and speed allowed you to predict duration more accurately by first predicting speed.\n",

    "Hopefully, it is apparent that all of these steps are required to reach a reliable conclusion about what inputs and model structure are helpful in predicting the duration of a taxi ride in Manhattan. "

    "\n",
    "- The regression model would have been more accurate if we had used the date itself as a feature instead of just the day of the week. Why didn't we do that?\n",
    "- Does collecting this information about every taxi ride introduce a privacy risk? The original data also included the total fare; how could someone use this information combined with an individual's credit card records to determine their location?\n",
    "- Why did we treat `hour` as a categorical variable instead of a quantitative variable? Would a similar treatment be beneficial for latitude and longitude?\n",
    "- Why are Google Maps estimates of ride time much more accurate than our estimates?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some possible extensions to the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An alternative to throwing out atypical days is to condition on a feature that makes them atypical, such as the weather or holiday calendar. How would you do that?\n",
    "- Training a different linear regression model for every possible combination of categorical variables can overfit. How would you select which variables to include in a decision tree instead of just using them all?\n",
    "- Your models use the observed distance as an input, but the distance is only observed after the ride is over. How could you estimate the distance from the pick-up and drop-off locations?\n",
    "- How would you incorporate traffic data into the model?"
